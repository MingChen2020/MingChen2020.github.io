Welcome to my blog!

I am a postgraduate student at the University of Manchester, pursuing my Master's. I focus on how modern technology can strongly change the way of teaching and learning at any workplace.

Previously, I had the experience of teaching for a few years and it's really interesting. In my spare time, I enjoy discovering websites and applications that can help improve the efficiency of learning.
