Welcome to my blog!

I am a postgraduate student at the University of Manchester. I focus on how modern technology can powerfully change the way of teaching and learning in any workplace.

Previously, I had the experience of teaching for a few years, and itâ€™s fascinating. In my spare time, I enjoy discovering websites and applications that can help improve the efficiency of learning.
